PROBLEM STATEMENT:
===============================================

Problem Statement ID: 25014
Problem Statement Title: Waste Segregation Monitoring System for Urban Local Bodies

Category: Hardware

Problem Description:
Urban local bodies struggle with improper waste segregation at the household level, 
leading to inefficiencies in waste processing and increased landfill burden. Despite 
awareness campaigns, compliance remains low due to lack of monitoring and feedback 
mechanisms. This issue is widespread in urban areas with high waste generation.

Impact:
Improper segregation affects nearly 70% of urban waste management systems, increasing 
recycling costs and environmental pollution. A solution would improve waste processing 
efficiency and reduce landfill dependency.

Expected Outcomes:
• IoT-based system or mobile app to monitor segregation at collection points
• Provide real-time feedback to households on compliance
• Generate compliance reports for local authorities to enforce better waste management

Relevant Stakeholders/Beneficiaries:
• Urban local bodies
• Residents
• Waste management agencies
• Environmental organizations

Supporting Data:
Swachh Bharat Mission Urban 2.0 Report, highlighting segregation challenges
